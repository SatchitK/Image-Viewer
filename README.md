Directions:

Run "python img_viewer.py". 

The GUI should let you open up the Raw Image Directory (Directory with Images + Labels works)
Then open the Raw Labels Directory (same directory as the Raw Image if you are saving labels and images in same folder)
Open the Inference Directory (the results from running inference code, these images have the bounding boxes drawn)

Type in the image name (without .png)

Note: no error checking is implemented, so if an image or label for the image doesn't exist it will terminate. Will add this soon!
